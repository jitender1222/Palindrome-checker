## In this project I make a palindrome checker -> A palindrome checker basically checks whether the given no. or string is palindrome or not.

## A number or string is Palindrome if when we read the number or string from the right and from the left is same and equal.

### For example -> `123 is not a palindrome because if we reverse the number its 321 and now if we compare the first number it does not match so it is not` 

### `121 is a palindrome because reading from the first and from the last it is same so it is palindrome .`


## Tech Used

1-> Html

2-> Css

3-> Javascript


## Time Required

I have make this Project in 45 minutes.


I have used `2 Pointer` Approach to solve this problem .

In this approach i take 2 Pointers one from the starting and one from the end if the number or character matches then we have to simply move the pointers we have to move left forward and right backward if in any time the character does not match it gives us false otherwise it gives us true and our string is a palindrome.
